    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of finance, the goal of RAG is to gather relevant financial data and pass it to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate informed outputs based on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieval** - Find relevant financial information given a query, e.g., \"What are the key factors influencing stock prices?\" -> retrieves passages related to stock market dynamics from financial reports or textbooks.\n",
    "* **Augmented** - We take the relevant financial data and augment our input (prompt) to the LLM with that specific information.\n",
    "* **Generation** - Combine the first two steps and pass them to an LLM to produce insightful, finance-specific outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more background on RAG, you can refer to the paper from Facebook AI: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)."

    "## Why RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of using RAG in finance is to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the outputs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preventing Misinterpretations** - LLMs are highly skilled at generating text that appears accurate, but this doesn't always mean the content is factually correct. In finance, where precision is crucial, RAG helps ensure that the information generated is based on reliable and relevant financial data, reducing the risk of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Working with Customized Financial Data** - Most LLMs are trained on large-scale, general data from the internet, giving them a broad understanding of language. However, this often leads to generic responses. RAG allows LLMs to generate more tailored outputs by leveraging specific financial documents, such as your company's financial reports or market analysis, ensuring that the responses are relevant and precise to the financial context."

The financial manager is at the crossroads of the real economy, with its industries  and services, and the world of finance, with its various financial markets and structures. There are two ways of looking at the financial manager’s role: t a buyer of capital who seeks to minimise its cost, i.e. the traditional view; t a seller of financial securities who tries to maximise their value. This is the view we  will develop throughout this book. It corresponds, to a greater or lesser extent, to  the situation that exists in a capital market economy, as opposed to a credit-based  economy. At the risk of oversimplifying, we will use the following terminology in this book: t the financial manager or chief financial officer (CFO) is responsible for financing  the firm and acts as an intermediary between the financial system’s institutions and  markets, on the one hand, and the company, on the other; t the business manager invests in plants and equipment, undertakes research, hires  staff and sells the firm’s products, whether the firm is a manufacturer, a retailer or a  service provider; t the financial investor invests in financial securities. More generally, the financial  investor provides the firm with financial resources, and may be either an equity inves- tor or a lender. Section 1.1 THE FINANCIAL MANAGER IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A SALESMAN . . . 1/ THE FINANCIAL MANAGER’S JOB IS NOT ONLY TO “BUY” FINANCIAL RESOURCES . . . The financial manager is traditionally perceived as a buyer of capital. He negotiates with a  variety of investors – bankers, shareholders, bond investors – to obtain funds at the lowest  possible cost.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'CORPORATE FINANCE 2 Transactions that take place on the capital markets are made up of the following  elements: t a commodity: money, t a price: the interest rate in the case of debt; dividends and capital gains in the case  of equities. In the traditional view, the financial manager is responsible for the company’s financial  procurement. His job is to minimise the price of the commodity to be purchased, i.e. the  cost of the funds he raises. We have no intention of contesting this view of the world. It is obvious and is con- firmed every day, in particular in the following types of negotiations: t between corporate treasurers and bankers, regarding interest rates and value dates  applied to bank balances (see Chapter 49); t between chief financial officers and financial market intermediaries, where nego- tiation focuses on the commissions paid to arrangers of financial transactions (see  Chapter 25). 2/ . . . BUT ALSO TO SELL FINANCIAL SECURITIES That said, let’s now take a look at the financial manager’s job from a different angle: t he is not a buyer but a seller; t his aim is not to reduce the cost of the raw material he buys but to maximise a sell- ing price; t he practises his art not on the capital markets, but on the market for financial instru- ments, be they loans, bonds, shares, etc. We are not changing the world here; we are merely looking at the same market from  another point of view: t the supply of financial securities corresponds to the demand for capital; t the demand for financial securities corresponds to the supply of capital; t the price, the point at which the supply and demand for financial securities are in  equilibrium, is therefore the value of security. In contrast, the equilibrium price  in the traditional view is considered to be the interest rate, or the cost of funds. We can summarise these two ways of looking at the same capital market in the following  table: Analysis/Approach Financial approach: ﬁnancial  manager as salesman Traditional approach: ﬁnancial  manager as purchaser Market Securities  Capital Supply Issuers Investors Demand Investors Issuers Price Value of security  Interest rate'}]"

       "  'text': 'CAPITAL STRUCTURE POLICIES 606 SECTION 4 relationship we shall examine in this chapter. A full chapter (Chapter 34) is devoted to  an analysis of the capital structure resulting from a compromise between creditors and  shareholders. Rather than being simply a search for value, the choice of ﬁnancing is far more an  endeavour to reduce conﬂicts of interest between shareholders and managers or share- holders and lenders, as well as the information asymmetry between management and  investors. Section 33.1 THE BENEFITS OF DEBT OR THE TRADEOFF MODEL 1/ CORPORATE INCOME TAXES Up to now, our reasoning was based on a tax-free world, which of course does not exist.  The investor’s net return can be two to five times (or more) lower than the pre-tax cash  flows of an industrial investment. It would therefore be foolhardy to ignore taxation, which forces financial managers  to devote a considerable amount of their time to tax optimisation. For financial managers, this chapter will cover familiar ground and our insistence on  the importance of tax aspects in every financial decision will seem obvious. But we ought not go to the other extreme and concentrate solely on tax variables.  All too many decisions based entirely on tax considerations lead to ridiculous outcomes,  such as insufficient earnings capacity. Tax deficits alone are no reason to buy a company! In 1963, Modigliani and Miller pushed their initial demonstration further, but this  time they factored in corporate income tax (but no other taxes) in an economy in which  companies’ financial expenses are tax-deductible, but not dividends. This is pretty much  the case in most countries. The conclusion was unmistakable: once you factor in corporate income tax, there is  more incentive to use debt rather than equity financing. Interest expenses can be deducted from the company’s tax base, so that creditors  receive their coupon payments before they have been taxed. Dividends, on the other hand,  are not deductible and are paid to shareholders after taxation. Thus, a debt-free company with equity financing of 100 on which shareholders  require a 10% return will have to generate profit of at least 15.4 in order to provide the  required return of 10 after a 35% tax. If, however, its financing is equally divided between debt at 5% interest and equity,  a profit of 13.6 will be enough to satisfy shareholders despite the premium for the greater  risk to shares created by the debt (i.e. 14.4%).   Operating proﬁt 13.6 − Interest expense 2.5 = Pre-tax proﬁt 11.1 − 35% tax 3.9 = Net proﬁt 7.2 or 14.4% of 50'}]"

Is there such a thing as an optimal capital structure, i.e. a way of splitting the ﬁnancing of  operating assets between debt and equity which would enhance the value of the operating  assets and minimise the company’s cost of capital? This is the central question that this  chapter attempts to answer. The real-world camp says yes, but without being able to prove it, or to set an ideal level of  net debt and equity. Modigliani and Miller said no in 1958, and showed how, if it were so, there would be arbi- trages that re-established the balance. For an investor with a perfectly diversiﬁed portfolio, and in a tax-free universe, there is no  optimal capital structure. The following rules can be formed on the basis of the above: t for any given investment policy and if no taxes are levied, value cannot be instantly  created by the choice of a “good” capital structure; t whether a given company is sold and the deal is paid in shares only, or whether the deal  is paid in a whole range of different securities (shares, debt, hybrid shares), this will  not change the value of its operating assets (excluding tax); t in a world without taxes, the expected leverage effect is an illusion. The cost of capital  (excluding tax) is linked to the company’s assets and is independent from the method  of ﬁnancing. But a world without taxes is a utopia, which is why the next chapter brings tax and other  “distortions” into the equation. SUMMARY 1/Why is the cost of equity for a company with no debt equal to the average weighted cost  of capital? 2/What is the cost of capital equal to? 3/What are the two risks for a shareholder of an indebted company? 4/Of the following decisions, which is the most important: An investment decision?  A financing decision? Why? 5/Explain what impact an increase in debt will have on the β of shares. 6/What are Modigliani and Miller’s theories based on? 7/The fact that shareholders’ expected returns rise with the level of debt does not run con- trary to the approach taken by Modigliani and Miller. Why? 8/Is the cost of capital an accounting or financial concept? 9/Why can it be dangerous to use a spreadsheet to create simulations of the cost of capital? 10/Can a company create value by going into debt?

       "  'text': 'Chapter 7 HOW TO COPE WITH THE MOST COMPLEX POINTS IN FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS 101 SECTION 1 US rules are very similar to the IASB’s. (c) How should ﬁnancial analysts treat them? Some analysts, especially those working for lending banks, regard brands as having nil  value from a financial standpoint. Such a view leads to deducting these items perempto- rily from shareholders’ equity. We beg to differ with this approach. These items usually add considerably to a company’s valuation, even though they  may be intangible. For instance, what value would a top fashion house or a consumer  goods company have without its brands? 4/ CONCLUSION To sum up, our approach to intangible fixed items is as follows: the higher the book value  of intangibles, the lower their market value is likely to be; and the lower their book value,  the more valuable they are likely to be. This situation is attributable to the accounting and  financial policy of a profitable company that seeks to minimise its tax expense as much as  possible by expensing every possible cost. Conversely, an ailing company or one that has  made a very large acquisition may seek to maximise its intangible assets in order to keep  its net profit and shareholders’ equity in positive territory. From a ﬁnancial standpoint, intangible ﬁxed assets form a key part of a company’s value.  That said, we believe that their book value in a company’s balance sheet has little to do  with ﬁnancial reality. Some are on the balance sheet because they were acquired, others  are not because they were created by the company. Where is the logic? Section 7.11 INVENTORIES 1/ WHAT ARE INVENTORIES? Inventories include items used as part of the company’s operating cycle. More specifi- cally, they are: t used up in the production process (inventories of raw materials); t sold as they are (inventories of finished goods or goods for resale) or sold at the end  of a transformation process that is either under way or will take place in the future  (work in progress). 2/ HOW ARE THEY ACCOUNTED FOR?

       "  'text': 'The range of the equity cost of capital estimates for each of the firms is significant. Consider, for example, Goodyear Tire and Rubber. According to MarketWatch, the beta for the company is 1.24, resulting in an estimated cost of equity capital between 9.20% and 12.92%. The beta provided by Yahoo! Finance is much higher, at 2.26. Using this higher beta results in an estimated equity cost of capital for Goodyear Tire and Rubber between 14.30% and 21.08%. This leaves the financial managers of Goodyear Tire and Rubber with an estimate of the equity cost of capital between 9.20% and 21.08%, using a range of reasonable assumptions. What is a financial manager to do when one estimate is more than twice as large as another estimate? A financial manager who believes the equity cost of capital is close to 9% is likely to make very different choices from one who believes the cost is closer to 21%. This is why it is important for a financial manager to have a broad understanding of the operations of a particular company. First, the manager must know the historical background from which these numbers were derived. It is not enough for the manager to know that beta is estimated as 1.24 or 2.26; the manager must be able to determine why the estimates are so different. Second, the manager must be familiar enough with the company and the economic environment to draw a conclusion about what set of assumptions will most likely be reasonable going forward. While these numbers are based on historical data, the financial manager’s main concern is what the numbers will be going forward. It is evident that estimating the equity cost of capital is not a simple task for companies. Although we do see a wide range of estimates in the table, some general principles emerge. First, the average company has a beta of 1. With a risk-free rate of 3% and a market risk premium in the range of 5% to 8%, the cost of equity capital will fall within a range of 8% to 11% for the average company. Companies that have a beta less than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that falls below this range, and companies that have a beta greater than 1 will have an equity cost of capital that rises above this range. Recall that a company’s beta is heavily influenced by the type of industry. Grocery stores and providers of food products, for example, tend to have betas less than 1. During recessionary times, people still eat, but during expansionary times, people do not significantly increase their spending on these products. Thus, companies such as Kroger, Coca-Cola, and Kraft Heinz will tend to have low betas and a range of equity cost of capital below 8% to 11%. The sales of companies in other industries tend to be much more volatile. During expansionary periods, people fly to vacation destinations and purchase new homes. During recessionary periods, families cut back on these discretionary expenditures. Thus, companies such as American Airlines and KB Homes will have higher betas and ranges of equity cost of capital that exceed the 8% to 11% average. The higher equity cost of capital is needed to incentivize investors to invest in these companies with riskier cash flows rather than in lower-risk companies. The CAPM estimate depends on assumptions made, but issues also exist with the constant dividend growth model. First, the constant dividend growth model can be used only for companies that pay dividends. Second, the model assumes that the dividends will grow at a constant rate in the future, an assumption that is not always reasonable. It also assumes that the financial manager accurately forecasts the growth rate of dividends; any error in this forecast results in an error in estimating the cost of equity capital. Given the differences in assumptions made when using the constant dividend growth model and the CAPM to estimate the equity cost of capital, it is not surprising that the numbers from the two models differ. When estimating the cost of equity capital for a particular firm, financial managers must examine the assumptions made for both approaches and decide which set of assumptions is more realistic for that particular company. 17.3 • Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital 515',\n",

If the interest rate is 10%, with interest payable every six months, then the interest rate is 5% for six months. We then have to calculate an effective annual rate (and not for six months), which is our point of reference and our constant concern. Two rates referring to two different maturities are said to be equivalent if the future value of the same amount at the same date is the same with the two rates. In our example, the lender receives €5 on 1 July which, compounded over six months, becomes 5 + (10% × 5) / 2 = €5.25 on the following 1 January, the date on which he receives the second €5 interest payment. This is the real cost of the loan, since the return for the lender is equal to the cost for the borrower. (1 ) (1 / ) + + t r n a n = Formula for converting nominal rate into effective annual rate. If the nominal rate (ra) is to be paid n times per year, then the effective annual rate (t) is obtained by compounding this nominal rate n times: where n is the number of interest payments in the year and ra/n the proportional rate dur- ing one period, or t = (1 + ra / n)n −1. It should be common sense that an investment at 10% paying interest every six months produces a higher return at year end than an investment paying interest annu- ally. In the first case, interest is compounded after six months and thus produces interest on interest for the next six months.',\n",

      "- Listing enables the company to access new sources of funding, to raise its corporate proﬁle and to incentivise managers and employees. During the preparation phase, the whole of the company’s legal, operational and ﬁnancial structure has to be reviewed, its corporate governance needs to be adapted, ﬁnancial statements may have to be drawn up in line with the relevant accounting principles and a strategy has to be deﬁned in the form of an equity story for the market. The choice of the market segment on which the company will be listed will be determined by the size of the company and by any constraints weighing on it. The number of shares offered on the market will depend on the sizing of the IPO, which will also determine whether the shares will be shares sold by existing shareholders and/or new shares in the company’s capital that are issued at the time. At the time of the IPO, shares are generally sold on the market at a discount of between 10 to 20% compared with the ﬁrst listed price. Delisting may be a good option when the company no longer requires funds or when liquidity has become too low. Delisting can also be a complex process and an independent expert has to be brought in to draw up a fairness opinion on the squeeze-out price.2/Why might shareholders prefer to sell their stakes in a company through an IPO rather than a straight sale to an investor?4/Why do companies that list their shares on the stock market have, more often than not, to change their corporate governance?5/Why is it difficult for a sole shareholder to sell 100% of his shares when the company undertakes an IPO?\n",
      "- Because there is no formal exchange present, it is possible that investors will have trouble finding buyers or sellers for their stocks. The two largest stock exchanges in the world, as measured by the market capitalization of the companies listed on the exchange, are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. Process of Offering Equities The primary market is the market for new securities, and the secondary market is the market for used securities. Having an active secondary market makes it easier for corporations to issue stock, as investors know they can resell if desired. With a typical IPO, a private company decides to raise capital and go public with the help of an investment banker. The investment banker agrees to provide financial advice, recommend the price and number of shares to issue, and establish a syndicate of underwriters to finance and ultimately distribute the new shares to investors (see Figure 12.3). An IPO is expensive for the issuing firm, and it can expect to incur costs of 5% to 8% or more of the value of the IPO. As of the end of 2020, the largest successful IPO belongs to Saudi Aramco, a petroleum company, valued at $25.6 billion at issue in December 2019.8 The Ant Group had planned an IPO valued at over $34 billion dollars in 2020, but as of the end of 2020 that issue was put on hold by the Chinese government.9 Institutional and preferred individual investors are typically the initial purchasers of IPOs. Investment author and financial expert Professor Burton Malkiel cautions that buying IPOs immediately after issue can be a money-losing investment. He cites research showing that, historically, IPOs have underperformed the market by an average of 4% per year.10 Another way for a corporation to raise capital in the equity market is through a seasoned equity offering (SEO).\n",

      " -  Listing enables the company to access new sources of funding, to raise its corporate proﬁle and to incentivise managers and employees. During the preparation phase, the whole of the company’s legal, operational and ﬁnancial structure has to be reviewed, its corporate governance needs to be adapted, ﬁnancial statements may have to be drawn up in line with the relevant accounting principles and a strategy has to be deﬁned in the form of an equity story for the market. The choice of the market segment on which the company will be listed will be determined by the size of the company and by any constraints weighing on it. The number of shares offered on the market will depend on the sizing of the IPO, which will also determine whether the shares will be shares sold by existing shareholders and/or new shares in the company’s capital that are issued at the time. At the time of the IPO, shares are generally sold on the market at a discount of between 10 to 20% compared with the ﬁrst listed price. Delisting may be a good option when the company no longer requires funds or when liquidity has become too low. Delisting can also be a complex process and an independent expert has to be brought in to draw up a fairness opinion on the squeeze-out price.2/Why might shareholders prefer to sell their stakes in a company through an IPO rather than a straight sale to an investor?4/Why do companies that list their shares on the stock market have, more often than not, to change their corporate governance?5/Why is it difficult for a sole shareholder to sell 100% of his shares when the company undertakes an IPO?\n",
      " -  Because there is no formal exchange present, it is possible that investors will have trouble finding buyers or sellers for their stocks. The two largest stock exchanges in the world, as measured by the market capitalization of the companies listed on the exchange, are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ. Process of Offering Equities The primary market is the market for new securities, and the secondary market is the market for used securities. Having an active secondary market makes it easier for corporations to issue stock, as investors know they can resell if desired. With a typical IPO, a private company decides to raise capital and go public with the help of an investment banker. The investment banker agrees to provide financial advice, recommend the price and number of shares to issue, and establish a syndicate of underwriters to finance and ultimately distribute the new shares to investors (see Figure 12.3). An IPO is expensive for the issuing firm, and it can expect to incur costs of 5% to 8% or more of the value of the IPO. As of the end of 2020, the largest successful IPO belongs to Saudi Aramco, a petroleum company, valued at $25.6 billion at issue in December 2019.8 The Ant Group had planned an IPO valued at over $34 billion dollars in 2020, but as of the end of 2020 that issue was put on hold by the Chinese government.9 Institutional and preferred individual investors are typically the initial purchasers of IPOs. Investment author and financial expert Professor Burton Malkiel cautions that buying IPOs immediately after issue can be a money-losing investment. He cites research showing that, historically, IPOs have underperformed the market by an average of 4% per year.10 Another way for a corporation to raise capital in the equity market is through a seasoned equity offering (SEO).\n",

From the start of this phase, the company should seek the assistance of an invest- ment bank, which will act as a link between the company and the market. The company will also have to retain the services of a law firm, an accounting firm and possibly a PR agency.10 LARGEST IPOS WORLDWIDE IN 2013 Rank Company Stock exchange Sector Proceeds (in$m) 1 BB Seguridade Participacoes SA Sao Paulo (BM&F BOVESPA) Financials 5677 2 Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd Tokyo (TSE) Consumer staples 3964 3 Royal Mail plc London (LSE) Consumer products and services 3170 4 Plains GP Holdings LP New York (NYSE) Energy 2912 5 Zoetis Inc New York (NYSE) Health care 2574 6 China Cinda Asset Management Co Ltd Hong Kong (HKEx) Financials 2256 7 Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc New York (NYSE) Media and entertainment 2200 8 BTS Rail Mass Transit Growth Infrastructure Fund Thailand (SET) Industrials 2127 9 Twitter Inc New York (NYSE) Technology 2093 10 Antero Ressources Corp New York (NYSE) Energy 1807 Source: Dealogic Section 42.3 EXECUTION OF THE IPO 1/ CHOOSING A MARKET With rare exceptions, the natural market for the listing is the company’s home country.

A successful IPO is the combination of a number of factors: t the intrinsic quality of the company: market share, growth and clarity of the activity, management experience, capital structure, should not be unusual, etc. These factors are assessed on the basis of comparable companies that are already listed, since the listing of the company is offering a new choice to investors within the same invest- ment universe;\n"
