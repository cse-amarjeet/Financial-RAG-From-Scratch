# Financial-RAG-From-Scratch

Welcome to the **Financial-RAG-From-Scratch** repository! This project is a custom-built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to handle financial queries precisely. Built from scratch, it leverages advanced NLP techniques to provide context-aware answers from extensive financial datasets, improving decision-making and knowledge discovery in finance.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up your environment and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setting Up a Python Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cse-amarjeet/Financial-RAG-From-Scratch
   cd Financial-RAG-From-Scratch
   ```

2. **Create a Python Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   # For Unix/macOS
   python3 -m venv venv

   # For Windows
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   # For Unix/macOS
   source venv/bin/activate

   # For Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### Installing Dependencies

Install all the required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code with Jupyter Notebook

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook** (if not already included in `requirements.txt`)
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open a browser window. From there, you can open and run the notebook files (`*.ipynb`) located in the project directory.

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks included in the repository to interact with the system. The notebooks contain examples and usage instructions to help you execute complex financial queries effectively.
